# Simple Calculator in C++

This project is part of my learning journey in programming.  
It’s a small calculator I built while practicing C++ basics, and it can perform:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%)

## Why I built this
I wanted to get comfortable with:
- Reading and writing data using `std::cin` and `std::cout`
- Using `switch` statements to handle different operations
- Dealing with common errors, like division by zero
- Trying out the `fmod()` function to calculate modulo with floating-point numbers
